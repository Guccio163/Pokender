## Pokemon app using bare React Native, React-Navigation and Onyx

- Using React-navigation and Onyx key-value store to let users view and like pokemons. Pokemons are downloaded from pokeapi.com.

- Pokender was used to learn react-navigation and onyx before starting contribution in Expensify project. Done during the start of Summer 2024 Internship in Software Mansion.

- Still not working: fully working typescript with problematic Onyx types (especially arrays), I chose not to investigate further (maybe in some free time).
